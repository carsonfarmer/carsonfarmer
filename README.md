### Carson Farmer ðŸ‘‹
__(he/him/his)__

I do research and development with @textileio. I'm also a former university professor turned distributed web and open source advocate. I enjoy working on advanced algorithms and peer to peer protocols. I'm interested in conflict free replicated data types, linked data, composability, network resilience, maps, and more. You can email me at carson.farmer@gmail.com or reach out to @carsonfarmer pretty much everywehre else.
